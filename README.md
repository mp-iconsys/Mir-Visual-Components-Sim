# Guides & Documentation

A couple of useful guides: 

* [Youtube Video #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv_U-MA6mEQ)
* [Youtube Video #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yT7kY3W0mU)

They have a fairly good breakdown so you don't need to trudge through all of it.

# The Gist

Alright, the gist of getting mirs to move is as follows:
1. Make a Works Pathway Area big enough to contain the robot and all of its destinations
1. Add Works Processes. These can do things (create objects and feed them to MiR) or they can exist as destinations between which to move
1. Add Works Resource Pathfinder. This can just sit there and look pretty.
1. Add Works_TaskControl. This is where we'll program what the robot has to do.
